Installing Pyflation is as simple as typing

$ python setup.py install

inside the directory where this file is located. 
First unpack the pyflation-x.x.x.tar.gz file in a suitable location. From the 
command line this can be done by using

$ tar xzvf pyflation-x.x.x.tar.gz

Then enter the created directory using

$ cd pyflation-x.x.x

The setup.py script will install pyflation in your local python installation. 
If you want to change the location of the installation list the possible options
using

$ python setup.py install --help

The most important option is --prefix which will change the base directory used
in deciding where to store the installation. The default depends on your 
installation and local python executable but is often /usr. For example if you 
want everything installed under the directory /home/me/localinstall/ then use

$ python setup.py install --prefix=/home/me/localinstall/

If you do not have the appropriate permissions you may not be able to install
to a system directory. In this case using the prefix option with a directory
you can write to is the best option.

Alternatively the virtualenv python module provides a useful way of keeping
python libraries in separate installations. This is useful if you work with
more than one version of a particular library and want to be able to run them
side by side. See http://virtualenv.openplans.org/ for more information.

Developer Installation
----------------------

If you do not want to install Pyflation into your system or local python 
site-packages directory, then it is possible to use it from within a separate
directory structure. This is how development of the code is carried out.
This method requires the Bazaar version control system to be installed.
In the unpacked directory run

$ bzr init
$ bzr add
$ bzr commit -m "New Install"

to initialise a Bazaar branch with the current directory as its contents.
To start a new run with the code copied into the run directory use the 
bin/pyflation-newrun.py script with the --copy-code and --codedir options.
Execution of the other scripts should be done from within the new run directory,
i.e. where run_config.py resides, or the run directory should be added to the
PYTHONPATH environment variable.
