CHANGELOG for Pyflation

08/09/2011 - Updated multifield functionality now includes calculating quantum mode 
matrix for first order modes. This allows full calculation of all cross terms in 
the power spectrum of the perturbations. A new nflation potential has also been
added which allows any number of scalar fields to be used with the same mass.

27/04/2011 - Added multifield syntax for PhiModels and the subclasses BackgroundModel
and FirstOrderModel. Note that the result of the first order model is now complex,
the previous split real and imaginary perturbations have been joined together.
